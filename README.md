# Monolith
By default, Android attempts to optimize apps for performance, but holds off on some optimizations to save storage space. Monolith recompiles Android packages with full DEX optimizations! 
This will consume a bit more storage on your device.

# Usage
- Download `monolith.sh` from this repository
- Through terminal (such as Termux, or through ADB), run the script using `sh /sdcard/Download/monolith.sh` or `bash /sdcard/Download/monolith.sh`
- Wait for it to complete, it may take some time but it'll be worth it!
